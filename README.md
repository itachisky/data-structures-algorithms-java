# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.

### Description

Welcome to this repository dedicated to exploring and solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems using Java! This repository is a comprehensive collection of coding problems and their solutions. It's designed for those who are looking to enhance their understanding of data structures and algorithms, and for those preparing for software engineering interviews.

### Structure

The repository is organized into various folders, each representing a different topic or category of problems, such as:

 - Recursion
 - LinkedList
 - [Other Topics]

Each Java file within these folders represents a unique problem. At the beginning of each file, we provide a detailed explanation of the problem. Following the problem description, you will find the solution with inline comments explaining the logic and thought process behind the approach.
